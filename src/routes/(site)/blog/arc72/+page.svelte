<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Understanding ARC-72 Tokens on Voi</h1>
<p class="mb-6">Various standards for Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have emerged across different chains. Voi has embraced the ARC-72 token standard, a new NFT standard implemented as smart contracts on AVM (Algorand Virtual Machine) blockchain networks. This article explores ARC-72 tokens, their benefits, and how they stand out compared to other NFT standards.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What Are ARC-72 Tokens?</h2>
<p class="mb-6">ARC-72 is a specification for NFTs on AVM blockchains, designed to be implemented as smart contracts. This is significantly different from ARC-3 NFT Tokens commonly found on Algorand. Embracing ARC-72 NFTs allows for richer functionality and greater flexibility, fostering a more interoperable and feature-rich NFT ecosystem.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Key Benefits of ARC-72 Tokens</h2>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li><strong>No Opt-In Required:</strong> Unlike ASAs, ARC-72 tokens do not require users to opt-in to receive them. This simplifies the user experience and reduces the friction in transferring NFTs.</li>
    <li><strong>Programmability:</strong> Being implemented as smart contracts, ARC-72 tokens offer extensive programmability. Developers can create custom methods and extend the functionality of NFTs beyond the basic ownership and transfer operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> ARC-72 aims to standardize the core interfaces for NFTs on Voi, ensuring compatibility across different applications and platforms.</li>
